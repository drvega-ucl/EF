## Vision
We believe that in the future, you will never forget anything. The challenge with memory is not the lack of knowledge but its inaccessibility. We aim to solve this problem by passively recalling contextually relevant information.

## Approach
While we cannot replicate the human mind, we can augment our mental processes. Our project leverages multiple modalities, using YOLOv8, Whisper, and Gemini Flash, to organize your lived experiences and update your personal knowledge graph.

## Outcome
This creates a "second brain" that combines the benefits of AI scale, reasoning, and computational power.
